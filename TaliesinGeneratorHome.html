        Reloading the page will generate a new character - the data does not get saved. 
        As a final step, before you start play, look over your equipment and feel free to cross out anything that's unnecessary or that's weighing you down. Good luck and happy adventuring!

    <div>If you're creating a basic, 1st-level D&D character, and need some background or detail about what they are doing, why, and who they are, consider 
        generating an 'Adventurer Profile' for them. It assumes that most 'adventurers' are rather... well, not normal people. Normal, sane people don't
        crawl into holes in the ground hoping to get rich. It also tells you who they know 'in town'. (Not intended for use with the generator above, but feel free to use it if you're lacking
        inspiration and want more detail!) </div>
